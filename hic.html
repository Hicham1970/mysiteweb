                    Of course, I'd be happy to explain the draft survey procedure in a way that even a landlubber can understand, with a dash of humor tossed in for good measure. 

                    **Step 1: Gather Your Tools**
                    First things first, you'll need a few essential tools: a clipboard, a pen, and a really, really long measuring tape. And don't forget your trusty sailor's hat - it's not required, but it adds a certain flair to the job!

                    **Step 2: Find a Ship**
                    Now, you can't exactly perform a draft survey in your bathtub, so head down to the nearest harbor. Look for a ship that's willing to let you work your surveying magic. Remember, ships can be a bit shy, so approach them with a smile and maybe a bag of sea salt-flavored potato chips to break the ice.

                    **Step 3: Measure the Draft**
                    The draft of a ship is just a fancy way of saying how deep it sits in the water. Imagine you're trying to measure how much of an iceberg is hiding beneath the surface, but without the risk of a Titanic disaster. Use that long measuring tape (which is really just a giant ruler) to measure how much of the ship is submerged.

                    **Step 4: Do the Math**
                    Now, let's get down to some serious business. You'll need to calculate the difference in draft between when the ship is empty and when it's loaded with cargo. This tells you how much stuff the ship is carrying. It's like figuring out how many pizzas your buddy ate at the all-you-can-eat buffet by measuring his height before and after.

                    **Step 5: Note the Weather**
                    The weather can be a tricky character in this whole draft survey saga. Waves and tides can make your measurements bounce around like a drunken sailor on shore leave. So, take note of the weather conditions and make adjustments as needed. It's like trying to balance on a tightrope during an earthquake.

                    **Step 6: Present Your Findings**
                    After all the measuring, calculating, and maybe a few laughs with the ship's crew, it's time to present your draft survey results. Write them down on your trusty clipboard and hand it over to the ship's captain or the cargo owner. They'll be delighted to know just how much their precious cargo weighs.

                    And there you have it, the draft survey procedure explained in plain English, with a sprinkle of humor. Remember, it's all about measuring water and cargo, not about writing Shakespearean sonnets. So grab your tools, head to the harbor, and let the draft surveying adventure begin! Just don't forget your sailor's hat - it's the key to success, or at least a good conversation starter.
